#PROBLEM 1: LENGABURU TRAFFIC

King Shan wants to visit the suburb of Hallitharam, and has 2 possible orbits and 3 possible vehicles to chose from.
Your coding challenge is to determine which orbit and vehicle King Shan should take to reach Hallitharam the fastest.

Goal: to go from Silk Dorb to Hallitharam in the shortest time possible.
Orbit options:
Orbit 1 - 18 mega miles & 20 craters to cross
Orbit 2 - 20 mega miles & 10 craters to cross
Vehicle options:
Bike - 10 megamiles/hour & takes 2 min to cross 1 crater
Tuktuk - 12 mm/hour & takes 1 min to cross 1 crater
Car - 20 mm/hour & takes 3 min to cross 1 crater
Weather conditions (affects the number of craters in an orbit):
Sunny - craters reduce by 10%. Car, bike and tuktuk can be used in this weather.
Rainy - craters increase by 20%. Car and tuktuk can be used in this weather.
Windy - no change to number of craters. Car and bike can be used in this weather.

#SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT

##SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT - I
Input: Weather is Sunny
Input: Orbit1 traffic speed is 12 megamiles/hour
Input: Orbit2 traffic speed is 10 megamiles/hour
Expected Output: Vehicle TukTuk on Orbit1

##SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT - II
Input: Weather is Windy
Input: Orbit1 traffic speed is 14 megamiles/hour
Input: Orbit2 traffic speed is 20 megamiles/hour
Expected Output: Vehicle Car on Orbit2
